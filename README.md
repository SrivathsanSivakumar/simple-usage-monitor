## CLI Tool - real-time token and cost estimator that lives in your terminal for Claude Code

- Know your token and dollar cost in __real-time__ as your type your prompts, in the same terminal, so you know how many tokens and associated cost your input uses.
- Tool seamlessly integrates with Claude Code with no additional setup needed! Just install and run `sumonitor` from anywhere to start. The tool will automatically start Claude Code for you along with the overlay.
- Your sessions are fully private. All the processing happens locally on your device.

### Supported Models
1. Opus 4.5
2. Sonnet 4.5
3. Haiku 4.5

Other models will still have accurate token counting, just not dollar cost.
